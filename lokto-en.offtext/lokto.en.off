^ck2(Leaving Home as a Monk to Fulfill a Family Vow)^n1
^n2 Instead of expounding on a Buddhist text as usual, I will instead speak to you all today on a less formal topic. As you all know, I am not able to speak Cantonese. Since this gathering was put together on short notice, I could not manage to find a Cantonese translator. I hope you will excuse me for speaking in Mandarin. 
^n3 About four years ago, a Taiwanese lay Buddhist, Shanqing, along with his wife Shanxue, requested that I share my life story publicly. He asked Rev. Dayi to record what I said and transcribe it into writing as something to remember me by. Translating the .Great Calming and Contemplation" has left me with no spare time to prepare a written text. Therefore, I would like to use the opportunity of today's talk to share my personal experiences with you all, in return for your concern and interest.
^n4 I was born into a peasant family in 1923, during the 12th year of the Republic of China. When I was six, I became desperately ill. Since this was so long ago and I was only a young child, I do not remember what exactly the illness was. I only remember that several doctors at the time confirmed that it was incurable. I was told that I lost consciousness five times, but eventually returned to life. My mother was very desperate and vulnerable then.
^n5 I was told that my grandmother advised my mother that, "This child has already lost consciousness several times already. Moreover, the doctors have confirmed that this illness will be fatal, even though he has not yet been pronounced dead." She therefore told my mother, "Being split up thousands of miles apart is better than separated by a piece of wood. You might as well pray to the Bodhisattva for blessings." By this she meant that it would be better to be separated by thousands of miles in distance as there might still be a chance for reunion. If a person was put inside a coffin, and thus was only a thin piece of wood away, there would be no chance of ever meeting again. 
^n6 My mother took my grandmother's advice and visited a temple over 10 li (about 3 miles) away from my home. 
There she prayed to the Bodhisattva for my full recovery. She proclaimed that, "If my child can be cured, I promise to send him to the monastery to become a monk."
^n7 Miraculously, I gradually recovered from my illness after she made her vow. One can say that I was born to be a monk. When I was 10, the temple reminded my mom to fulfill her vow, so my family then sent me to live in the temple as promised. That is why I claim that "I became a monk at the age of 10".
^n8 At the beginning, all I learned in the temple was simple methods of prostrating and worshipping. Because I had left home at such a young age, I was often homesick and wanted to go home all the time.
^n9 I had an elder brother and three younger sisters. I missed them and wanted to go home to play with them. Hence, I often lied to my master with excuses such as "I need to go home to get some clothing", or "My mother wants me to visit home" etc. Even though he knew that I was lying, my Master still granted me permission to leave. He saw that I was still young and could not help being homesick.
^ck3(II. Ordination and Academic Training)^n1
^n2 When I was 12, I relocated to another temple about 70 li (more than 20 miles), or one full day's walking distance from home, to be initiated into monkhood. After that, I didn't have much opportunity to go home.
^n3 At the age of 16, I received Full Ordination under the guidance of Venerable Master Xiaozhou at Xinghua Temple on Yunlong Mountain in Xuzhou (Jiangsu).
^n4 According to the precept regulations, full ordination should only be obtained at the age of 20. Yet another interpretation is that if one calculates the age from the moment one is conceived in one's mother's womb, then the age of 18 is sufficient for ordination. There were many monks at the ordination ceremony with me, with quite a few under aged. After discussion, the masters decided that they would make an exception as long as the teenagers were able to complete the ordination.
^n5 In order to permit under aged monks to receive ordination, we were required to kneel beside the passage to the dining hall, letting others enter first. When others were leaving the hall, we had to kneel by the passage again to let them pass by. Being disciplined in this manner for more than 20 days, we were considered to have passed the probation and permitted to receive the ordination. 
^n6 In the classroom, we had to learn the 5 segments of the daily services, the meaning of ordination and how to practice all kinds of rituals. I remember how, one year, Japanese monks asked that we Chinese monks learn their language at their temple 3 times a week, for about a year. 
^n7 At the age of 18, I arrived at Cham Shan Temple in Qingdao, and began my Buddhist education at Cham Shan Buddhist Academy. At that time, Grand Master Tanxu was 65 years old. 
^n8 Before being admitted to the Buddhist Academy, we only learned the five segments of the daily service. We were not exposed to the doctrines and theories of Buddhism. After I began my study in the academy, I gradually comprehended the profoundness and significance of Buddhism. At that time, living conditions at Cham Shan were quite satisfactory. Although it was during the Japanese occupation, we still ate very well. Conditions worsened about two years later, about two years before Japan's surrender. We had to rely on food rations. We could only get things like dried sweet potatoes, poor quality rice, and flour made from mixed coarse grains. This was the norm for Qingdao at the time. Although life was difficult, we still relished it. 
^n9 In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Japan surrendered. Then in the following year, the government of the Republic of China reestablished Nanjing as the capital, started constitutional reform, and appointed Chiang Kaishek (Jiang Jieshi) as the President. With the approval of the government, Master Tanxu established the Chinese Buddhist Association in the capital city, Nanjing, with branches throughout various provinces and cities, organizing and processing Sangha registration. We all participated in these matters.
^n10 During the inauguration of the Qingdao branch Buddhist Association, Prof. Liang, a professor from a university in the United States, was invited as the keynote speaker. He mentioned that Americans were not yet exposed to Buddhism and yet they were in desperate need of such teachings to calm their decadence. This speech had an intense impact on me and set my aspiration to learn English and propagate Dharma in US in the future.
^n11 I was 26 then and had not even learned the English alphabet, but I was determined to learn English. About a dozen of my classmates were also interested, so we requested the Abbot to hire an English teacher for us. He agreed immediately, and soon after, a teacher was appointed to teach us English. After 3 days of lessons, only two or three people were left in the whole class. Yet another 2 days later, I became the only student. Although the others all got cold feet, I was very determined to master the English language.
^n12 I remember that it was 1946, when I received a letter from a classmate called Liao Yin, who was teaching Buddhism at the East Putuo Temple in Hong Kong at the time. He had been my classmate at Cham Shan. In his letter he invited me to travel South to pay a visit to Hong Kong. Although I did not respond to his invitation, the idea took root deep in my mind, as I considered Hong Kong an appropriate place to improve my English.
^ck4(III. Journey to the South with much Adversity)^n1
^n2 In May of the following year, I invited two classmates to go to Hong Kong with me, planning to learn English there. Since they were younger, I thought that they could master the English language more quickly and be able to achieve more than me in the future. 
^n3 The three of us were going to take a ship from Qingdao to Shanghai, then from Shanghai to Hong Kong. We were using "Gold Yuan" banknotes at that time, and the currency value was very unstable. At the time of our departure from Qingdao, we had prepared just enough money to get us to Hong Kong. 
However, to our surprise, when we arrived in Shanghai and were ready to buy tickets to transit to Hong Kong, the money that had been enough to pay for three tickets could now only purchase two. I had no choice but to send one of my travel companions to Hangzhou to reside temporarily with another classmate who was an abbot there at the time. When I returned to Shanghai, the money was no longer enough even for two tickets, so I had to go to Hangzhou once again to help the other classmate settle in as well. Upon my return, with the money we had, we could not even purchase one single ticket to Hong Kong! All I could do was to trade my belongings such as clothes and socks for money in order to pay for the balance of my trip. Eventually, I got a ship ticket to Hong Kong, which by then cost 40 million Yuan due to inflation. I finally took the steamship called "Shengjing" and arrived in Hong Kong.
^ck5(IV. Uprooted from my Homeland Searching for a Path Forward )^n1
^n2 When the ship entered Hong Kong Harbor, smaller boats were required to transfer passengers to shore. I had no clue where East Putuo was and only remembered that the Eastern Lotus Enlightenment Monastery was located in Happy Valley. So I hired a rickshaw to get there, only to find out that it was a nunnery and thus not appropriate for me to reside in. Unfortunately, I learned the sad news from one of the nuns that my classmate, Liao Yin, had passed away three months before my arrival.
^n3 My journey to Hong Kong had been inspired by Liaoyin, but he had passed away. The news left me in distress. After I had a meal, the reception monk sent a young monk to accompany me to take public transportation to go to East Putuo Temple in Kowloon where I settled in. 我因了因师的因缘而来，此时了因已圆寂，一时也
^n4 East Putuo was a co-ed temple where monks and nuns resided, practiced and dined together. This was not a common phenomenon in the North. Although I was not accustomed to the arrangement, I had no choice but to adapt to it. The plan was to stay temporarily until another option emerged.
^n5 I then heard of an organization called Dao Feng Shan. It was located in the same neighborhood as our temple, so I went to have a look. They claimed to be a religious study group formed by Danish, Swiss and Norwegian religious practitioners. On the surface, they enrolled young students for religious studies. However, their underlying intention was to sabotage the practice of Buddhism. I stayed there 19 for only a few days, and during that time, I witnessed over thirty young monks abandoning Buddhism in favor of Christianity. Daily lectures were provided.
^n6 When I first got there, I was only looking for lodging, trying to take a look at the research methods of comparative religious studies, and also fulfilling my curiosity.
^n7 There were three foreign reverends and a Chinese one named Wang Yongqing. They were all devoted Christians. One day, Rev. Wang invited me to his home and introduced their study programs to me. He then showed me a log book with detailed information on many Chinese monks, including their photos and corresponding addresses, all applying to study at his organization. I knew their objective was to destroy the Buddhist Sangha community, so I left there soon and went somewhere else. 
^n8 While lodging at Dao Feng Shan, I had visited the Xilin Temple in Sha Tin. Their abbot, Wan Qing, had been a police officer in Guangzhou before he became a monk. His wife had also become a nun and lived at the temple. After settling in, I began to write about my experience at Dao Feng Shan. Three months later, I completed a booklet revealing their conspiracy.
^n9 Since I did not have the financial resources to publish the booklet, I sought help from the abbot. Although he said he approved of the content, he would only publish it under the condition that I not leave his temple in the future. After much discussion, the booklet was published. We then mailed copies to various temples and Buddhist academies in Mainland China, disclosing the conspiracy of Dao Feng Shan to dissuade them from studying there. After a while, I came to the conclusion that I could not stay at Xilin Temple long term. I made up some stories and told the abbot that I was taking a leave of absence for three months.
^n10 I then went looking for Master You Tan in Happy Valley, hoping to borrow money for transportation back to Qingdao. The Elder Master Tanxu was well aware of my language barrier, which made residing and preaching in Hong Kong rather difficult. He asked the monk Shan Bo to persuade me to leave Hong Kong and return to Qingdao. With financial support from senior lay Buddhist, Wang Xue Ren, Master You Tan helped me purchase a return ticket back to Shanghai.
^ck5(V. Corrupt Buddhist Practice in Shanghai)^n1
^n2 When I first became a monk, my master warned me not to dwell in Shanghai, as their lifestyle would make my religious practice go . downhill". When I landed in Shanghai many years later, I chose to stay for a while and explore in depth. I wanted to understand what the city's shortcomings were. So I took up residence in various places and got a sense of the real situation.
^n3 On the whole, Shanghai disappointed me. There were many places performing Buddhist rituals, but there was very little knowledge of Buddhist Dharma. I prefer not to go into detail on this as it would be sinful even to discuss it. In my opinion, the Buddhist community was very corrupted back then. The only way to revive it would be to demolish it in its entirety and rebuild. Just like a collapsing house, the only way to fix it would be to tear it down and start again.
^ck7(VI. Escaping from Qingdao, Seeking Sanctuary down South)^n1
^n2 Upon my return to Qingdao, I immediately reported in detail to Elder Master Tanxu, the abbot. Only ten days later, the Nationalist forces at Ji'nan collapsed. The People's Liberation Army was only 100 miles away from Qingdao at Wei County. The abbot Shan Bo came to me and said, "The situation in China is urgent, we will have to flee. It will be easier for younger monks because they can set up lodgings in any temple. Because senior monks are older and have higher status, they can't just move into another temple. It might cause problems. Also, Master Tanxu has connections with some senior officials within the Nationalist Party. When the Communists arrive they will surely detain him the way they did with the Venerable Master Xuyun. As northerners, we lack contacts in the southern temples. Since you just came back from the south, please go back to the south and see if any arrangements can be made."
^n3 At the time I felt deeply conflicted. If I had been able to stay in the South, I would not have returned to Qingdao.However, if I refused to go back to the south to help make arrangements, I could not imagine what would happen to Master Tanxu when the Communists arrived. In the absence of any constructive solution to this difficult dilemma, I chose to place all my energy and hope into the good hands of the Bodhisattva of Compassion, Guan Yin. With renewed confidence, I agreed to go to Hong Kong once again, this time to help prepare an escape route for Master Tanxu.
^n4 At this time, residents in Qingdao felt very insecure and apprehensive. Alarming things happened several times per day. My classmates at the academy noticed that I was leaving for the south again after only 13 days. They could sense something serious was about to happen. So they secretly boarded the ship in batches, hid inside the cabins and reached Shanghai together with me.
^n5 After we arrived in Shanghai, we had to divide into five or six groups to find local temples for lodging. I stayed in Fazang Temple for three or four days, then in Puji Temple for five or six days. One day, a lay Buddhist came to Puji Temple looking for me and enquired about my plan of going south. This rekindled our hope of continuing our southward journey. I then took the train, with my four classmates: Sing Hung, Shenghuai, Zhikai and Dacheng, south to Hangzhou. We could only travel one step at a time, hoping to reach Hong Kong eventually.
^n6 The train was very crowded when we set out from Hangzhou during this Chinese New Year period. Disregarding our hunger, we travelled from dawn to dusk and, overcoming many challenges, eventually reached Guangzhou. It was New Year.s Eve when we reached Liurong Temple. The monks at that temple recognized me from my booklet about Dao Feng Shan so they welcomed us warmly and let three of us stay there temporarily. 
Dacheng and I continued our journey to Hong Kong, and went back to Xilin Temple in Sha Tin to withdraw my leave of absence.
^n7 While living at Xilin Temple, I carried out daily services, while trying to figure out an exit strategy for Elder Tanxu. My only hope was with lay Buddhist Ye Gongchuo. If I could find him and ask for his help, I believe there would be a solution. However, looking for him was like finding a needle in the haystack. Where could I hunt him down?
^ck8(VII. Finding a Needle in the Haystack)^n1
^n2 During my first three months in Hong Kong, I kept trying to find Lay Buddhist Ye. As time passed, and I still had not found any clues as to his whereabouts, I started to feel anxious. Actually, Master Jueguang and Lay Buddhist Wang Xueren both knew where Ye lived, but they preferred not to divulge the information to me. Every time I enquired about him, they always told me that Ye was in Guangzhou. When I wrote to Master Sing Hung who was still in Guangzhou at that time, he replied and confirmed that Ye was in Hong Kong. I continued searching high and low. Three months flew by with no news about Ye at all. I remained unable to take care of the matter that my master had entrusted to me and meanwhile the political situation in Mainland China continued to deteriorate. I started to get really anxious. At that time the only gleam of hope was a rhymed couplet written on wood, hung on the door frame of an abandoned courtyard at Chan Yue Lin monastery located in a ravine below Wanfo temple in Sha Tin. The rhymed couplet was written by Ye. I believed that Ye was in Hong Kong, but finding someone in a boundless crowd of people was a really tough task.
^n3 Begging for blessings from the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin) was my last resort. Although I had been chanting the Bodhisattva's name over the years, my prayers were particularly intense and sincere during every moment of these three critical months. 
^n4 One day, I had a dream in which I was walking on a trail to the forest. The closer I got to the forest, the more spacious and brighter I felt. I kept walking until I saw a shabby temple in front of me. The characters "Guan Yin Mu" were written on the girder. I could not understand why the word "Mu", meaning admire, was used here. I was wondering if it might have been mistakenly written for another "Mu" character which meant tomb. While I was hesitating, I saw an old lady in black approaching me from behind. She looked like she was from the countryside. I walked toward her, and asked her where I was. She answered nonchalantly, "You are at the Guan Yin Mu". I asked, "Does anyone live here now?" She said confidently "Follow me". We then entered through the temple's main gateway together. There were four doors in the hallway, two on the left, and two on the right. The old lady entered into one of the doors. I was afraid that it was her lodging area, so I waited outside, not following her in.
^n5 I waited for a long while, but she did not return. I had no option but to follow the path walking further toward the back. I discovered that to the back there was a great hall. The tiles were falling off. Looking more carefully, I saw a statue of Avalokitesvara (Guan Yin) on the altar. Whenever a monk like me encounters a statue of the Buddha or of a Bodhisattva, we naturally prostrate ourselves without any hesitation. I then walked closer the Bodhisattva and bowed. Nothing happened after my initial prostration, but when I went began my second one, the Bodhisattva step down from the altar and blessed my head. I then woke up, astonished.
^ck9(VIII. Blessing from the Manifestation of the Bodhisattva)^n1
^n2 During that time, Ye was famous for his calligraphy and painting. People scrambled to obtain his works for their collections. Someone told me a vital clue. Most of his works were mounted by a shop called "Jiu Hua Tang" in Lascar's Row, Hong Kong. So I went to "Jiu Hua Tang" right away. I met the store owner, and explained why I was looking for Ye. I said I hoped he could tell me Ye's address. Even with my sincere attitude, the owner only promised to help me deliver a letter, and nothing else. I had no choice but to pass along a hand written letter to Mr. Ye from Elder Master Tanxu, hoping that it would find its way to Ye.
^n3 The relationship between Master Tanxu and Mr. Ye began in the Buddha's Seal Society (佛印社) at the Guanzong Temple in Ningbo. While studying under the guidance of Master Dixian in this Buddhist organization, Master Tanxu became acquainted with Mr. Ye, who at that time was the director of the Buddha's Seal Society. Mr. Ye was deeply impressed by Master Tanxu and respected him greatly. In addition, both men had connections to several other monasteries, including Jile monastery in Harbin and Cham Shan monastery in Qingdao. I was quite confident that Ye would response immediately upon viewing the letter.
^n4 After 3 or 4 days, Ye sent his student Lou Wangzan to meet me in Sha Tin. Lou graduated from Jiaotong University and then worked as a manager at the Bank of East Asia on Queen's Road. When we met, I explained why I needed to see Mr. Ye and that I hoped to discuss Master Tanxu's situation with Mr. Ye in person. He accepted my request and arranged a time in the following week for me to go to Mr. Ye's home with him. 
^n5 I had hoped to talk to Ye alone and did not expect that there would be so many people there on that day. Master Jueguang, Lay Buddhist Wang Xueren and Lay Buddhist Lin Lengzhen and Lou Wangzan, a total of five people  were all present. When we were there, they were chatting casually about other things the whole time and I did not get a chance to bring up the issue I wanted to discuss with Mr. Ye. When we were about to leave, Mr. Ye told me to write a letter to Master Tanxu in Qingdao on his behalf. He asked me to leave the envelope unsealed and send it to his place. He would mail it to Master Tanxu in Qingdao by airmail after he reviewed it. I followed his instructions, wrote the letter and sent it unsealed to Mr. Ye's place. 
^n6 Several days later, I finally got a chance to meet with Mr. Ye alone. We talked about the situation in mainland China and Master Tanxu's plan of going to Hong Kong to teach Dharma and open a Buddhist college. Although I did not explicitly say that he wanted to flee the Mainland as a refugee, he understood the situation well. We also talked about other topics like propagating Dharma and opening a Buddhist college. He promised that he would wait a few days and respond to me depending on the situation. He said he would explore the possibility of borrowing a place for Master Tanxu's accommodation. Failing that, perhaps he might spend some money to buy a small property in order provide Master Tanxu with a place to live comfortably and teach scriptures.
^ck10( IX. Revitalization of Cham Shan from Ruins)^n1
^n2 Due to Mr. Ye's personal reputation, Wang Xueren and two other board members agreed to help us borrow a long-abandoned two-storey building. It used to be Hong￾fa Temple where Master Bao Jing resided. The building was thought to be haunted, so it had been vacant for some time.
^n3 We immediately started to clean and fix up the building. As soon as everything was in order, we invited Master Tanxu, who was temporarily residing in Xianghailian Temple at that time to move in. This marked the milestone where Cham Shan's lineage was established in Hong Kong.
^n4 As far as finances were concerned, Lay Buddhist Wang Xueren stated up front that he would only be willing to lend the property to us. He took no responsibility for any other daily expenses that we incurred in the future. At that time, the number of student monks migrating from the North was multiplying. When we opened the Buddhist school, Lay Buddhist Lou Wangzan had set some policies upfront. The maximum number of students would be limited to 10. Our monthly expenses were set at $ 1,000 HKD. Mr. Ye named the new school "South China Buddhist Learning School". The meaning was a bit different from the proposed Buddhist college. 
^n5 More than 30 students arrived from Qingdao, and obviously it became too crowded to fit into the house. But everyone was begging our teacher to let them stay. Therefore, Master Tanxu discussed the situation with Mr. Ye and proposed to accept 10 more students without increasing the allowance. So we ended up with 20 students. In order to cut our expenditures and balance the budget for our school, we started to engage in household chores such as chopping wood and planting vegetables. 
^n6 Amidst all kinds of difficulties, two classes completed their studies. Afterwards, no new students were enrolled. The Buddhist learning school closed down and we had to return the property to the landlord.
^n7 Later, we acquired a piece of land on the mountain behind Lai Chi Kok and built the Tiantai Monastery and a Dixian memorial hall. With donations from devotees, we then purchased a flat on Boundary Street and transformed it into a library open to all readers. We thus entered into the next phase of our religious development in Hong Kong. The year was 1958.
^ck11(X. Pioneer from the East to the West)^n1
^n2 After things settled down in Hong Kong, I wanted to try something new. I had two options at the time: one was to enroll into University of Calcutta in India; the other one was going to the United States to spread the Dharma. In the end, I decided to go to the United States. I was introduced to Wu Peilin, the abbot of the Buddhist & Taoist Academy in San Francisco, by Master Xiaoyun. He helped me apply for my immigration status in America. I only stayed in San Francisco for six months. Due differences in religious beliefs and rituals, I could not adapt to their ways. Others also advised me that it was not appropriate for a Buddhist monk to live in a Taoist temple, but there were no other options at that time. 
^n3 Due to aging and physical deterioration, Master Tanxu passed away in Hong Kong in 1963. I went to Hong Kong to help make funeral arrangements. Some lay Buddhists suggested that I should take the opportunity to order the manufacture of some Buddha statues while in Hong Kong and have them shipped to the United States, in preparation for the establishment of a new temple in San Francisco in the future.
^n4 I went back to San Francisco in the following year. Invitations to visit New York City kept coming from lay Buddhists, such as Huang Yujing, Jiang Ren Qixiu and Ying Jin Yutang. In response to their sincere and warm invitation, I finally reached New York City on March 15th 1964. 43
^n5 In early April, thanks to the assistance from Huang Yujing, his wife Jiang Ren Qixiu, and Ying Jin Yutang, an apartment on Bailey Ave in the Bronx was rented for my temporary stay. I set the place up as a temple with the three Tathagata statues from Hong Kong on the altar. We then initiated the application to form The Buddhist Association of United States (BAUS). In October, we received approval for the application and we were officially recognized as a Buddhism organization. 
^n6 Two years later, Lay Buddhist Mr. and Mrs. Shen Jiazhen, bought an abandoned operation station from the electricity company. He rented it to The Buddhist Association of United States. We spent much effort to clean up the mess and to repair, renovate and decorate it into a solemn monastery. We set up the three Tathagata statues for worship. This is the current Temple of Enlightenment.
^n7 In 1967, riots frequently broke out in Hong Kong, making everyone scared and nervous. Master Sing Hung and Master Shing Cheung wrote to me expressing their intention to leave Hong Kong for the United States. Although I embraced the idea of them coming to the United States to propagate Dharma together, in the end they were unable to obtain a visa for the United States.
^n8 The World Expo was held in Montreal during that year. People from all over the world were welcome to attend. Master Sing Hung and Master Shing Cheung used the opportunity afforded by the Expo to enter Canada.
^n9 I went to Canada to meet them. Even though the three of us were reunited in Canada, the circumstances were not favorable at all. We were in a foreign country, faced with a language barrier and with little financial support. We found it extremely difficult to settle in, never mind establishing a temple to preach the Dharma.
^n10 We sought help from many quarters, but nothing worked out. Eventually, with the blessings from the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, and help from Lay Buddhists Jiang, Jin, and many others, we successfully established The Buddhist Association of Canada in 1968, based in Toronto. We also were able to obtain a very small temple to accommodate the two masters.
^n11 The audiences here today all have the benefit of great merit. You have this grand monastery in which to honor the Buddha, chant sutras, and attend Dharma sermons. You might not know how truly harsh, long, and challenging the journey that led us here was at the beginning. I hope that everyone will cherish this opportunity and will not prove unworthy of the generous blessings bestowed by the Buddha and Bodhisattvas.
^ck12(XI. Buddhism Blossoms in North America)^n1
^n2 Our hard work in America and Canada bore fruit. The number of Buddhist devotees continued to grow, while the places for worship kept multiplying. Everyone can attest to the blossoming of Buddhism here. As for the development of Cham Shan in Canada, Master Sing Hung will report in detail in the next day or two so I will not dwell on it now.
^n3 In the United States, we established The Buddhist Association of San Francisco in 1972 as a token of thanks for having taken care of me back then. Buddhist activities flourished in other locations as well. Thanks to blessings from the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, the number of Buddhist followers and sites kept growing. I strongly believe that Buddhism will eventually flourish, like spring blossoms, covering the great prairies of North America.
^ck13(XII. Translating, Publishing, and Propagating the Dharma)^n1
^n2 I ran the Buddhist Association of United States for exactly 10 years. During that time, I had no respite from the multitude of everyday tasks. Therefore, in 1974, having found a successor to take over, I handed over my responsibilities and founded The Young Men's Buddhist Association of America instead, where I could concentrate on carrying out my initial aspiration of coming to America to translate Buddhist texts into English and propagating the Dharma.
^n3 The facility for the Young Men's Buddhist Association was quite small. We only had a dozen or so members, but everyone shared the same goal and motivation in translating, publishing and circulating Dharma books for free. Up to the present, we have published over 30 Dharma collections in various languages, mainly English with some works in French and Spanish. The content includes Buddhist liturgy, Tiantai, Zen, and Pure Land teachings. The circulation exceeds 100,000 copies. We intentionally did not register copyrights, allowing anyone to republish as they wish.
^n4 Translating a Chinese sutra into an English version involves many steps, including drafting, typing, proofreading, copy editing, cross referencing, polishing, formatting, publishing and binding etc. Upon completion, we would respond to requests from all over the world by packaging and mailing the publications free of charge. The positive feedbacks we received from the recipients motivated and energized us all to volunteer our time and effort. Readers kept telling us that upon reading our publications, they were able to encounter, understand and believe in Buddhism, with some even taking Buddhist vows or becoming monks. 
^n5 The sutra I am translating now is the collection of twenty classic sutras selected by Emperor Yongzheng from the Qing Dynasty. .If anyone is interested in looking for it, it is Volume 168 ( 经海一滴) in The Imperial Tripitaka. These are all important classics of Mahayana Buddhism. 
^n6 The first drafts of the 40 volumes of Mahaparinirnana Sutra, along with the two additional chapters have been completed. I worked for 6 ½ years on this translation. The material is still in the process of typesetting, editing, cross referencing and polishing. I hope it will be published soon. After that, I am planning to work on the three fundamental collections of the Tiantai sect.
^n7 The three fundamental collections of Tiantai sect are the "Great Calming and Contemplation" (Mo ke zhi guan), "The Subtle Connotation of the Lotus Sutra" (Fa hua xuanyi), and "The Verses of the Lotus Sutra" (Fa hua wen ju). These texts by the founder of the Tiantai sect, the Great Master Zhizhe, are fundamental to that tradition. They were gathered, edited and organized by Zhang An, the empowered one. As a follower of the Tian Tai school of Buddhism, it is truly my responsibility to promote the inherited teachings of my predecessors.
^n8 The first draft of "The Great Calming and Contemplation" is mostly done. Next, I will work on "The Subtle Connotation of the Lotus Sutra" and "The Verses of the Lotus Sutra". Hopefully I can fulfil my wish to complete translating them during this lifetime, in order to set a solid foundation for other successors to continue.
^n9 I became a monk when I was young in an era afflicted by warfare and unrest. I drifted from place to place for most of my life. Thanks to the blessings from the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, I am in good health. In order to express my gratitude towards the Buddha, I am willing to do whatever I can for Buddhism.

^ck14(Questions & Answers)^n1
^n2 Questions：Translating Dharma into English in order to benefit our English reading audience is definitely a good thing. Now that we have learned of your French and Spanish versions of these publications, do you have plans to do more translation and publishing in those languages to benefit an even broader audience?
^n3 Answers: This is a great suggestion, but it will take time. Let's take my English translation work as an example. It involves a first English draft from the original Chinese text, then typing, proofreading, cross referencing and polishing. Meanwhile, we need to go back and forth to verify the accuracy compared to the primary text, keeping sight of the readability and flow of the translated materials. Once we have approval from all members of the translation committee, then we move on to the designing, formatting, printing and publishing of the materials. That's how it works for English. None of us is fluent in French or Spanish though. Despite the fact that we are willing to hire and compensate someone to translate from Chinese, or even from English into other languages, people with these skills are indeed hard to find. In my experience, many people can master the two languages, but such people lack the knowledge of Buddhism. Please keep in mind that this is not a simple act of translating word to word, but rather a translation of the essence of the Buddhist doctrine. A translator needs to be equipped with the three essential elements of mastering Chinese, English, and most importantly, the Dharma. 
^n4 In terms of circulation, we insisted on not registering copyrights. Our translations are openly available for any person or organization to republish as they wish. Take the example of the "Sermons on the Heart Sutra" by Grand Master Tanxu. The English version has been republished many times by the Buddhist Education Foundation in Taiwan, with tens of thousands of copies in circulation. Similarly, books are republished in Hong Kong and Singapore, without copyrights, to facilitate the publishing process and allow for broader circulation.
^n5 Question: Do you produce any reading material specifically for teenagers?
^n6 Answer: Not yet. We have considered and discussed doing so, but nothing has come of it yet. 
^n7 Question: Master, printing these books is costly. What is the source of your financial support?
^n8 Answer: I am only a poor monk, with no savings to spare. My money for printing the books came from the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. She is the boss behind the scenes. As long as I work hard to finish my tasks, the Bodhisattva will help me. I don't have to worry about the financial side. The Bodhisattva will inspire devotees to donate for printing.
^n9 Here is a piece of advice to all of you. Have faith in the Buddha and Bodhisattvas and you will be blessed in return. With the right view and right understanding, sacrifice oneself for the benefit of others and you will see the benefits in time.
^ck15(The End)^n1
^n2 This conversation with our Master summarizes his 80 year journey, across China, Hong Kong, the United States, and Canada. It covered not only his Tiantai inheritance, but also the Dharma quest of Cham Shan devotees and the four categories of Buddhist disciples. It is a collage of the transformation of many individuals and incidents over a period of four decades with great historical value. The reporter who had the privilege to transcribe and organize this tape recording is deeply touched.
^n3 Although Master Lok To was already at an advanced age, he was healthy with a sharp mind, eloquent in speech and logical in his thinking. His dialogue is profound yet easy to comprehend. No wonder everyone in the audience was inspired. Laughter and applause could be heard throughout the recording.
